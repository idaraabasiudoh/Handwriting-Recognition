# Handwriting-Recognition
This project demonstrates image classification using the MNIST dataset with TensorFlow. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits, which are divided into training and testing sets. The goal of this project is to train a neural network to recognize and classify these handwritten digits.
