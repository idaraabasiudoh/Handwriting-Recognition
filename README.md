# **Image Classification with TensorFlow**

## **Project Description**
This project demonstrates image classification using the MNIST dataset with TensorFlow. The MNIST dataset is a collection of 70,000 handwritten digits, which are divided into training and testing sets. The goal of this project is to train a neural network to recognize and classify these handwritten digits.

## **Installation Instructions**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/idaraabasiudoh/Handwriting-Recognition
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd https://github.com/idaraabasiudoh/Handwriting-Recognition
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## **Usage**
1. Run the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook ImageClassification.ipynb
   ```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the MNIST dataset, preprocess the data, build the model, and train it.
